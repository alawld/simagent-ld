// code/eslint.config.ts
// ESLint 10 flat config with per-directory overrides for the Subterrans sim/render boundary.
// Source: RESEARCH.md Pattern 1, lines 180–316 — verified against ESLint 10 + @typescript-eslint 8 docs.
//
// Three config objects, applied in order:
//   1. baseConfig         — baseline TS rules for all src/**/*.ts AND bench/**/*.ts
//   2. simSafetyConfig    — PRD §6 Rule Sets 1 & 2: Phaser ban, wall-clock ban, float+division ban (src/sim/** only)
//   3. nonSimMutationGuard — FNDN-07 tripwire: catches obvious direct writes to WorldState fields
//                            from src/render/, src/input/, src/platform/
//
// NOTE: The nonSimMutationGuard is a TRIPWIRE — it catches shallow top-level field assignments.
// Nested writes (world.ants.alive[id] = 0) are NOT caught here; they are caught by
// scripts/check-sim-boundary.sh (the grep backstop). See RESEARCH.md Pattern 1c for details.

/** Non-sim layers: tripwire for obvious writes to WorldState sim-state fields.

 *  Platform IS included here because the accumulator must only READ sim-state fields
 *  (e.g., world.tick) and PUSH/DRAIN commandQueue.
 *
 *  SCOPE HONESTY — WHAT THIS RULE CATCHES vs MISSES:
 *  Catches (shallow, top-level assignments where the LAST property-name matches a banned field):
 *    world.tick = 0                         ✓ caught
 *    worldState.rngState = 123              ✓ caught
 *    world.colonies = {}                    ✓ caught (whole-field replacement)
 *    world.tick++  /  --world.nextEntityId  ✓ caught (UpdateExpression selector)
 *  MISSES (nested / computed writes):
 *    world.colonies[id].foodStored = 100    ✗ LAST property is `foodStored`, not in regex
 *    world.ants.posX[eid] = 50             ✗ LAST property is computed index
 *    const w = world; w.tick = 1           ✗ aliased variable defeats selector
 *  → The real backstop for nested writes is scripts/check-sim-boundary.sh (Pattern 1c).
 *
 *  NOTE: `commandQueue` is intentionally ABSENT from the regex below.
 *  Staging-seam writes (world.commandQueue.push(...), world.commandQueue = [])
 *  are the CORRECT write pattern from non-sim layers and MUST pass.
