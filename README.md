# Subterrans

A modern ant colony simulation game, built for the web. A spiritual successor to Maxis's *SimAnt* (1991) — same core idea (you are the colony, not an individual ant; you influence behavior through allocation and pheromones rather than direct control), with contemporary design, determinism, and moddability baked in from the start.

> **Status:** early development. The simulation is working end-to-end and playable at a rough level; art, audio, and polish are ongoing. Expect things to change. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

## What's In The Box Today

- A deterministic, headlessly-runnable ant colony simulation (20 Hz fixed tick, integer math, seeded PRNG).
- Queens laying eggs, larvae maturing into workers, workers foraging, digging, nursing, and dying of starvation when you mismanage them.
- Food pheromone trails and danger trails that decay over time.
- Per-colony underground excavation with chambers and nest entrances.
- Surface and underground views with a toggle, camera pan, minimap, HUD, and the classic behavior-triangle allocation widget.
- Colony-vs-colony combat, rally points, and cross-grid invasions (rally fighters on an enemy entrance and they go underground).
- Full save/load with deterministic replay — the same seed plus the same input log reproduces a session exactly.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's next and what's explicitly out of scope.

## Play It

Subterrans is a browser game. Public hosted builds are not published yet during early development; to try it, clone and run locally (see [Build & Run](#build--run) below).

## Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LightAxe/subterrans.git
cd subterrans/code
npm install
npm run dev       # launches Vite dev server, opens in browser
```

Requirements:
- **Node.js 22 LTS or newer**
- A Chromium-based browser for the Playwright E2E suite (`npx playwright install` on first run).

Useful scripts:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit/integration tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright browser tests |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript in `--noEmit` mode |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run verify` | Lint + typecheck + sim-boundary check + tests (what CI runs) |

## How This Is Built

Subterrans has strict architectural rules that exist to support determinism, testability, and long-term portability. The short version:

- **`src/sim/` is pure TypeScript.** No Phaser, no DOM, no browser APIs, no `Math.random`, no `Date`, no floating-point math. The simulation runs in Node headlessly.
- **Fixed 20 Hz tick.** Rendering interpolates between ticks; simulation never sees wall-clock time.
- **Render and input layers read simulation state; they never mutate it.** All state changes go through a typed command queue.
- **Everything is deterministic.** A recorded seed plus input log reproduces a run tick-for-tick.

Quick pointers:
- Small fixes: open a PR.
- Anything on the roadmap: open an issue to claim it, then PR.
- Anything *off* the roadmap: talk to us first — see [ROADMAP.md § How to Influence the Roadmap](ROADMAP.md#how-to-influence-the-roadmap).
